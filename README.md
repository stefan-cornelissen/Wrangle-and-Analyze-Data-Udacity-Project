# Wrangle-and-Analyze-Data-Udacity-Project
This Udacity project aims to practice a typical data wrangling process. This includes gathering data from a variety of sources, such as CSV-files, TSV-files and an API: The Twitter-API. Then its cleanly- and tidiness will be assessed in order to correct quality issues, converting the data to a tidy dataset. This happens according to the rules of tidiness https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html. 

Once quality and tidiness is assured, the sources will be combined to one or more master datasets before finally analyzing and visualizing it.  Note: Assessing and wrangling the entirety of the dataset would require more time than provided by Udacity. They, therefore, required to find at least eight quality and two tidiness issues to be assessed and cleaned. Keep in mind, there may be more issues still present.
